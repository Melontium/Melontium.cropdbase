# CropDB - Base Crop Set

This project is a proof-of-concept to demonstrate a basic implementation of the
[CropDB Spec] to represent a set of common fruit/vegetable crops and the data
that describes their growth and cultivation requirements.

For more information on the format of these files, see the [CropDB Spec].
